## The relationship between miles per gallon (MPG) and other variables associated with cars.

This app helps you to view the relationship of any variable in the mtcars dataset with the mpg variable.

First, you need to input the variable whose relationship with mpg you want to view. This information will be used to create a box plot of this variable versus mpg. Also, a linear model will be fit with these two variables it's plot and summary will be provided.
